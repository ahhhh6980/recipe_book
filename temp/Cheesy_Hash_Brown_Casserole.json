    "articleBody": "Crisp on the outside and cheesy on the inside, hash brown casserole is an easy dish that will please a crowd whether it's served at breakfast or dinner. A béchamel, or creamy roux-based sauce, serves as the base for the casserole alongside thawed frozen shredded hash browns. A cup of sour cream adds a tangy silkiness to the mix, which counters the starchiness of the potatoes.\nLooking for a crispier top on your hash brown casserole? Mix in all of the shredded cheddar cheese instead of reserving some for the topping, and the casserole should come out with a beautiful golden brown crust. This hash brown casserole recipe is simple but can be adapted by adding in some of your other favorite ingredients: crumbled cooked bacon, sliced scallions or mushrooms, fresh herbs, different cheeses—have fun and experiment! And while making the béchamel for this breakfast casserole isn’t difficult, you could substitute a low-sodium cream of chicken, cheese, or celery soup, being sure to adjust your seasoning—start with less salt and taste before baking.\nThe casserole can be made up to two days ahead and reheated just before serving. To do so, bake it until bubbling but not browned on top—about 10 minutes shy of the cooking time. Let cool, then cover and chill. To serve, heat in a 350° oven until bubbling and browned on top. This family favorite can also be cooked completely and cooled, cut, and frozen to be reheated and enjoyed by the slice later on.",
