It tastes great, is easy to make, and can feed a decent amount of people. We used fresh thyme and oregano and it really made the flavor pop. Plus, I'm ten and I still like it, so it's good no matter what age you are. Also, the lemon sauce seems like it would taste good on a salad.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"AMANDA"},"reviewBody":"This was soooo good!
