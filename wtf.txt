  1) Season the Spatchcock Chicken:
  1) In a small bowl, stir together one tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper, until combined.
  1) Generously smear the seasoning mixture over the whole chicken inside and out and let it rest on a clean plate for at least 15 minutes.  Make sure the seasoning covers the entire whole chicken including the inside cavity.

   Remove the turkey from the Instant Pot

       4) Let the gravy simmer for a minute or two until thickened
   Carve and serve

2 : "Instant Pot Turkey Breast and Gravy"
 If needed, place the turkey breast on a cutting board and using a sharp knife trim the turkey breast of any excess neck bone, rib bones that go beyond the breasts, or extra skin
Pat the turkey breast dry with paper towels
 Select the Sauté setting on the Instant Pot and add the olive oil
When the olive oil is hot (after about 2 minutes), add the onions and garlic
 Stir in the chicken broth and the remaining 1 teaspoon of the chopped herbs
 Place a steam wire rack in the Instant Pot on top of the onions and garlic
Make sure the two handles are facing upwards
This will help you pull it out after the turkey cooks
 Secure the lid on the Instant Pot and make sure the vent on the lid is turned to sealing, not venting
Select the Pressure Cook or Manual setting and set the cooking time to 35 minutes at high pressure
 When the cooking program ends, carefully (the steam will be very hot, so use heat-resistant oven mitts or use a kitchen towel) release the pressure in the pot by moving the vent on the lid from sealing to venting
When the pressure has fully released (you will stop hearing a hissing sound, and the float valve will sink down), open the Instant Pot
 Use a meat thermometer to take the temperature of the turkey breast at its thickest part
It should be at least 165ºF
 If you don’t have an air fryer lid, set the oven to broil on high
The oven rack should be set so that the turkey breast is 6 to 8 inches from the heating element, but it should also be low enough to fit the pot insert
Transfer the Instant Pot’s stainless steel inner pot with the turkey breast into the oven
 Whether you transferred the stainless steel inner pot to the oven or used the air fryer lid on the Instant Pot to crisp the skin, it’s time to remove the turkey and the wire steaming rack from the pot
Wearing heat-resistant oven mitts, grasp the handles of the wire rack and lift the turkey out of the pot
Transfer it to a serving platter or carving board to rest while you finish making the gravy
 Sprinkle the flour over the onions and cooking liquid
Use an immersion blender to blend the mixture until smooth
If you don’t have an immersion blender, carefully transfer the mixture into a blender to blend until smooth, then transfer it back into the pot
Select the sauté setting on the Instant Pot
Let the gravy simmer for a minute or two until thickened
 Use a sharp knife to carve the turkey breast off the rib bones

	Roasted Spatchcock Chicken (Butterflied Chicken)

From: https://www.aheadofthyme.com/roasted-spatchcock-chicken-butterflied-chicken/

Quick and easy roasted spatchcock chicken (butterflied chicken) seasoned with garlic and thyme is juicy, tender, delicious and flavourful with minimal prep.

Estimated Prep Time:  55 minutes
Servings: 1

Ingredients:
  0) 1  whole chicken  (3 to 4 lbs.)
  1) 2 tbsps olive oil divided
  2) 1 tbsp salt
  3) 1/2 tbsp ground black pepper
  4) 3  cloves garlic peeled  (+ 1 tablespoon minced)
  5) 1  sprig rosemary
  6) 2-3  sprigs thyme  (+1 tablespoon chopped)

Directions: 
  Spatchcock the Chicken:
     0) Pat dry the whole chicken completely dry with a paper towel before adding seasoning. This helps create extra crispy skin when roasting.
     1) Place chicken breast-side down on a clean and dry chopping board (wearing disposable gloves helps with easy handling).
     2) Cut along the backbone in the middle with kitchen scissors and remove the backbone, which is about 1-inch wide.
     3) Make a small cut with a knife along the white cartilage that connects the breastbone and remove the breastbone by pulling it out through the cut.
     4) Turn the chicken over with the breast-side up and flatten it out . Tuck the wings under the chicken breasts.
     5) Pat dry the spatchcock chicken again to remove any excess liquid.
  Season the Spatchcock Chicken:
     0) In a small bowl, stir together one tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper, until combined.
     1) Generously smear the seasoning mixture over the whole chicken inside and out and let it rest on a clean plate for at least 15 minutes.  Make sure the seasoning covers the entire whole chicken including the inside cavity.
  Roast the Chicken:
     0) Preheat the oven to 450F.
     1) Heat a cast-iron skillet on the stove for 5 minutes over medium high heat (or preheat the iron skillet in the oven for 5 minutes). Once the skillet is sizzling hot, sear the chicken by placing chicken breast side down in the hot skillet for 3-5 minutes, until skin gets a little crispy.
     2) Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake the chicken for 30 minutes until the skin on the breasts turns brown. You can add an oven-safe weight over the chicken such as a Dutch oven lid to promote browning.
     3) Remove the skillet from the oven and turn the chicken over with the breast side up. Tuck whole garlic cloves and sprigs of rosemary and thyme underneath the chicken to add flavour.
     4) Combine the remaining oil, chopped thyme and minced garlic in a small bowl and brush the seasoning mixture over the chicken breasts.
     5) Transfer the skillet back into the oven and continue to bake the chicken for another 10 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 165F.
     6) Remove the chicken from oven and place it on a large plate. Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes. Then, carve and serve.

   Remove the turkey from the Instant Pot
       0)  Whether you transferred the stainless steel inner pot to the oven or used the air fryer lid on the Instant Pot to crisp the skin, it’s time to remove the turkey and the wire steaming rack from the pot

	Roasted Spatchcock Chicken (Butterflied Chicken)

From: https://www.aheadofthyme.com/roasted-spatchcock-chicken-butterflied-chicken/

Quick and easy roasted spatchcock chicken (butterflied chicken) seasoned with garlic and thyme is juicy, tender, delicious and flavourful with minimal prep.

Estimated Prep Time:  55 minutes
Servings: 1

Ingredients:
  0) 1  whole chicken  (3 to 4 lbs.)
  1) 2 tbsps olive oil divided
  2) 1 tbsp salt
  3) 1/2 tbsp ground black pepper
  4) 3  cloves garlic peeled  (+ 1 tablespoon minced)
  5) 1  sprig rosemary
  6) 2-3  sprigs thyme  (+1 tablespoon chopped)

Directions: 
  Spatchcock the Chicken:
     0) Pat dry the whole chicken completely dry with a paper towel before adding seasoning. This helps create extra crispy skin when roasting.
     1) Place chicken breast-side down on a clean and dry chopping board (wearing disposable gloves helps with easy handling).
     2) Cut along the backbone in the middle with kitchen scissors and remove the backbone, which is about 1-inch wide.
     3) Make a small cut with a knife along the white cartilage that connects the breastbone and remove the breastbone by pulling it out through the cut.
     4) Turn the chicken over with the breast-side up and flatten it out . Tuck the wings under the chicken breasts.
     5) Pat dry the spatchcock chicken again to remove any excess liquid.
  Season the Spatchcock Chicken:
     0) In a small bowl, stir together one tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper, until combined.
     1) Generously smear the seasoning mixture over the whole chicken inside and out and let it rest on a clean plate for at least 15 minutes.  Make sure the seasoning covers the entire whole chicken including the inside cavity.
  Roast the Chicken:
     0) Preheat the oven to 450F.
     1) Heat a cast-iron skillet on the stove for 5 minutes over medium high heat (or preheat the iron skillet in the oven for 5 minutes). Once the skillet is sizzling hot, sear the chicken by placing chicken breast side down in the hot skillet for 3-5 minutes, until skin gets a little crispy.
     2) Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake the chicken for 30 minutes until the skin on the breasts turns brown. You can add an oven-safe weight over the chicken such as a Dutch oven lid to promote browning.
     3) Remove the skillet from the oven and turn the chicken over with the breast side up. Tuck whole garlic cloves and sprigs of rosemary and thyme underneath the chicken to add flavour.
     4) Combine the remaining oil, chopped thyme and minced garlic in a small bowl and brush the seasoning mixture over the chicken breasts.
     5) Transfer the skillet back into the oven and continue to bake the chicken for another 10 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 165F.
     6) Remove the chicken from oven and place it on a large plate. Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes. Then, carve and serve.

  Scrape the pan drippings into the gravy
     0)  You don't have to do this, but it will add even more flavor to your gravy

   Check for doneness
       0)  Use a meat thermometer to take the temperature of the turkey breast at its thickest part
       1) It should be at least 165ºF

       2) Transfer the Instant Pot’s stainless steel inner pot with the turkey breast into the oven
   Remove the turkey from the Instant Pot
       0)  Whether you transferred the stainless steel inner pot to the oven or used the air fryer lid on the Instant Pot to crisp the skin, it’s time to remove the turkey and the wire steaming rack from the pot
       1) Wearing heat-resistant oven mitts, grasp the handles of the wire rack and lift the turkey out of the pot
       2) Transfer it to a serving platter or carving board to rest while you finish making the gravy
   Make the gravy
       0)  Sprinkle the flour over the onions and cooking liquid
       1) Use an immersion blender to blend the mixture until smooth

       3) Select the sauté setting on the Instant Pot
       4) Let the gravy simmer for a minute or two until thickened
   Carve and serve

Ingredients:
   0) 6 tbsp unsalted butter plus more for pan
   1) 1  small onion finely chopped
   2) 1/4 cup all-purpose flour

	Roasted Spatchcock Chicken (Butterflied Chicken)
	By: Sam | Ahead of Thyme

From: https://www.aheadofthyme.com/roasted-spatchcock-chicken-butterflied-chicken/

Quick and easy roasted spatchcock chicken (butterflied chicken) seasoned with garlic and thyme is juicy, tender, delicious and flavourful with minimal prep.

Estimated Prep Time:  55 minutes
Servings: 1

Ingredients:
  0) 1  whole chicken  (3 to 4 lbs.)
  1) 2 tbsps olive oil divided
  2) 1 tbsp salt
  3) 1/2 tbsp ground black pepper
  4) 3  cloves garlic peeled  (+ 1 tablespoon minced)
  5) 1  sprig rosemary
  6) 2-3  sprigs thyme  (+1 tablespoon chopped)

Directions: 
  Spatchcock the Chicken:
     0) Pat dry the whole chicken completely dry with a paper towel before adding seasoning. This helps create extra crispy skin when roasting.
     1) Place chicken breast-side down on a clean and dry chopping board (wearing disposable gloves helps with easy handling).
     2) Cut along the backbone in the middle with kitchen scissors and remove the backbone, which is about 1-inch wide.
     3) Make a small cut with a knife along the white cartilage that connects the breastbone and remove the breastbone by pulling it out through the cut.
     4) Turn the chicken over with the breast-side up and flatten it out . Tuck the wings under the chicken breasts.
     5) Pat dry the spatchcock chicken again to remove any excess liquid.
  Season the Spatchcock Chicken:
     0) In a small bowl, stir together one tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper, until combined.
     1) Generously smear the seasoning mixture over the whole chicken inside and out and let it rest on a clean plate for at least 15 minutes.  Make sure the seasoning covers the entire whole chicken including the inside cavity.
  Roast the Chicken:
     0) Preheat the oven to 450F.
     1) Heat a cast-iron skillet on the stove for 5 minutes over medium high heat (or preheat the iron skillet in the oven for 5 minutes). Once the skillet is sizzling hot, sear the chicken by placing chicken breast side down in the hot skillet for 3-5 minutes, until skin gets a little crispy.
     2) Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake the chicken for 30 minutes until the skin on the breasts turns brown. You can add an oven-safe weight over the chicken such as a Dutch oven lid to promote browning.
     3) Remove the skillet from the oven and turn the chicken over with the breast side up. Tuck whole garlic cloves and sprigs of rosemary and thyme underneath the chicken to add flavour.
     4) Combine the remaining oil, chopped thyme and minced garlic in a small bowl and brush the seasoning mixture over the chicken breasts.
     5) Transfer the skillet back into the oven and continue to bake the chicken for another 10 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 165F.
     6) Remove the chicken from oven and place it on a large plate. Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes. Then, carve and serve.

  13) 3 tbsp flour
  14) 3 cups of turkey stock  (that you make in step...)
  15) 1/2 tsp yellow mustard
  16) 1/2 tsp salt
  17) 1/4 tsp pepper
  18) 1/2 tsp dried thyme
  19) 1/4 cup cream

Directions: 
  Preheat the oven
  Prep the turkey wings
     0)  Using poultry sheers or a sharp knife, separate each turkey wing into 3 segments—drumette, flat, and tip
  Slow roast the turkey wings
     0)  Place turkey wing drumettes and flats, skin side up, onto a rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan
     1) Toss with olive oil
     2) Sprinkle with salt
  Make the stock
     0)  While the turkey wing drumettes and flats are roasting, make stock with the tips
     1) Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium, thick-bottomed pot on medium high heat
     2) Add the turkey wing tips and let them brown on all sides
     3) Add the chopped carrot, onion, and celery, and sauté them for a few minutes with the wings
     4) Add 3 cups of water, enough to cover the wings and vegetables, and salt
     5) Bring to a boil on high heat, then reduce to a low simmer on the lowest setting
  Strain the stock
     0)  When the wings are close to being done, strain the stock so you can start making the gravy
     1) Remove and discard the largest solids from the pot
     2) Then strain the rest of the stock through a fine mesh strainer
     3) You should have about 3 cups of stock
  Make the gravy

  Broil the wings to brown them

     1) Remove the foil and place the wings on a rack a few inches under the broiler
  Scrape the pan drippings into the gravy
     0)  You don't have to do this, but it will add even more flavor to your gravy
     1) If the drippings are really stuck to the pan, place the roasting pan on your stovetop and turn on the burners under the pan
     2) Add a cup of water to the pan and use a metal spatula to scrape up the drippings
     3) Pour them off into the gray pot
     4) To serve, pour the gravy over the wings
  Serve the turkey wings with gravy
     0)  To serve, pour the gravy over the wings

   Remove the turkey from the Instant Pot

	Roasted Spatchcock Chicken (Butterflied Chicken)
	By: Sam | Ahead of Thyme

From: https://www.aheadofthyme.com/roasted-spatchcock-chicken-butterflied-chicken/

Quick and easy roasted spatchcock chicken (butterflied chicken) seasoned with garlic and thyme is juicy, tender, delicious and flavourful with minimal prep.

Estimated Prep Time:  55 minutes
Servings: 1

Ingredients:
  0) 1  whole chicken  (3 to 4 lbs.)
  1) 2 tbsps olive oil divided
  2) 1 tbsp salt
  3) 1/2 tbsp ground black pepper
  4) 3  cloves garlic peeled  (+ 1 tablespoon minced)
  5) 1  sprig rosemary
  6) 2-3  sprigs thyme  (+1 tablespoon chopped)

Directions: 
  Spatchcock the Chicken:
     0) Pat dry the whole chicken completely dry with a paper towel before adding seasoning. This helps create extra crispy skin when roasting.
     1) Place chicken breast-side down on a clean and dry chopping board (wearing disposable gloves helps with easy handling).
     2) Cut along the backbone in the middle with kitchen scissors and remove the backbone, which is about 1-inch wide.
     3) Make a small cut with a knife along the white cartilage that connects the breastbone and remove the breastbone by pulling it out through the cut.
     4) Turn the chicken over with the breast-side up and flatten it out . Tuck the wings under the chicken breasts.
     5) Pat dry the spatchcock chicken again to remove any excess liquid.
  Season the Spatchcock Chicken:
     0) In a small bowl, stir together one tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper, until combined.
     1) Generously smear the seasoning mixture over the whole chicken inside and out and let it rest on a clean plate for at least 15 minutes.  Make sure the seasoning covers the entire whole chicken including the inside cavity.
  Roast the Chicken:
     0) Preheat the oven to 450F.
     1) Heat a cast-iron skillet on the stove for 5 minutes over medium high heat (or preheat the iron skillet in the oven for 5 minutes). Once the skillet is sizzling hot, sear the chicken by placing chicken breast side down in the hot skillet for 3-5 minutes, until skin gets a little crispy.
     2) Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake the chicken for 30 minutes until the skin on the breasts turns brown. You can add an oven-safe weight over the chicken such as a Dutch oven lid to promote browning.
     3) Remove the skillet from the oven and turn the chicken over with the breast side up. Tuck whole garlic cloves and sprigs of rosemary and thyme underneath the chicken to add flavour.
     4) Combine the remaining oil, chopped thyme and minced garlic in a small bowl and brush the seasoning mixture over the chicken breasts.
     5) Transfer the skillet back into the oven and continue to bake the chicken for another 10 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 165F.
     6) Remove the chicken from oven and place it on a large plate. Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes. Then, carve and serve.

  19) 1/4 cup cream

  Preheat the oven

     0)  Place turkey wing drumettes and flats, skin side up, onto a rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan
     1) Toss with olive oil
     2) Sprinkle with salt
  Make the stock
     0)  While the turkey wing drumettes and flats are roasting, make stock with the tips
     1) Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium, thick-bottomed pot on medium high heat
     2) Add the turkey wing tips and let them brown on all sides

  Scrape the pan drippings into the gravy
     0)  You don't have to do this, but it will add even more flavor to your gravy

     2) Add a cup of water to the pan and use a metal spatula to scrape up the drippings
     3) Pour them off into the gray pot
     4) To serve, pour the gravy over the wings

   Cook the onions and garlic
       0)  Select the Sauté setting on the Instant Pot and add the olive oil

       2) Transfer the Instant Pot’s stainless steel inner pot with the turkey breast into the oven
   Remove the turkey from the Instant Pot
       0)  Whether you transferred the stainless steel inner pot to the oven or used the air fryer lid on the Instant Pot to crisp the skin, it’s time to remove the turkey and the wire steaming rack from the pot

       2) Transfer it to a serving platter or carving board to rest while you finish making the gravy

       3) Select the sauté setting on the Instant Pot
       4) Let the gravy simmer for a minute or two until thickened

	Roasted Spatchcock Chicken (Butterflied Chicken)
	By: Sam | Ahead of Thyme

From: https://www.aheadofthyme.com/roasted-spatchcock-chicken-butterflied-chicken/

Quick and easy roasted spatchcock chicken (butterflied chicken) seasoned with garlic and thyme is juicy, tender, delicious and flavourful with minimal prep.

Estimated Prep Time:  55 minutes
Servings: 1

Ingredients:
  0) 1  whole chicken  (3 to 4 lbs.)
  1) 2 tbsps olive oil divided
  2) 1 tbsp salt
  3) 1/2 tbsp ground black pepper
  4) 3  cloves garlic peeled  (+ 1 tablespoon minced)
  5) 1  sprig rosemary
  6) 2-3  sprigs thyme  (+1 tablespoon chopped)

Directions: 
  Spatchcock the Chicken:
     0) Pat dry the whole chicken completely dry with a paper towel before adding seasoning. This helps create extra crispy skin when roasting.
     1) Place chicken breast-side down on a clean and dry chopping board (wearing disposable gloves helps with easy handling).
     2) Cut along the backbone in the middle with kitchen scissors and remove the backbone, which is about 1-inch wide.
     3) Make a small cut with a knife along the white cartilage that connects the breastbone and remove the breastbone by pulling it out through the cut.
     4) Turn the chicken over with the breast-side up and flatten it out . Tuck the wings under the chicken breasts.
     5) Pat dry the spatchcock chicken again to remove any excess liquid.
  Season the Spatchcock Chicken:
     0) In a small bowl, stir together one tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper, until combined.
     1) Generously smear the seasoning mixture over the whole chicken inside and out and let it rest on a clean plate for at least 15 minutes.  Make sure the seasoning covers the entire whole chicken including the inside cavity.
  Roast the Chicken:
     0) Preheat the oven to 450F.
     1) Heat a cast-iron skillet on the stove for 5 minutes over medium high heat (or preheat the iron skillet in the oven for 5 minutes). Once the skillet is sizzling hot, sear the chicken by placing chicken breast side down in the hot skillet for 3-5 minutes, until skin gets a little crispy.
     2) Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake the chicken for 30 minutes until the skin on the breasts turns brown. You can add an oven-safe weight over the chicken such as a Dutch oven lid to promote browning.
     3) Remove the skillet from the oven and turn the chicken over with the breast side up. Tuck whole garlic cloves and sprigs of rosemary and thyme underneath the chicken to add flavour.
     4) Combine the remaining oil, chopped thyme and minced garlic in a small bowl and brush the seasoning mixture over the chicken breasts.
     5) Transfer the skillet back into the oven and continue to bake the chicken for another 10 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 165F.
     6) Remove the chicken from oven and place it on a large plate. Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes. Then, carve and serve.

  16) 1/2 tsp salt
  17) 1/4 tsp pepper
  18) 1/2 tsp dried thyme
  19) 1/4 cup cream

Directions: 
  Preheat the oven
  Prep the turkey wings
     0)  Using poultry sheers or a sharp knife, separate each turkey wing into 3 segments—drumette, flat, and tip
  Slow roast the turkey wings
     0)  Place turkey wing drumettes and flats, skin side up, onto a rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan
     1) Toss with olive oil
     2) Sprinkle with salt
  Make the stock
     0)  While the turkey wing drumettes and flats are roasting, make stock with the tips
     1) Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium, thick-bottomed pot on medium high heat
     2) Add the turkey wing tips and let them brown on all sides
     3) Add the chopped carrot, onion, and celery, and sauté them for a few minutes with the wings
     4) Add 3 cups of water, enough to cover the wings and vegetables, and salt
     5) Bring to a boil on high heat, then reduce to a low simmer on the lowest setting
  Strain the stock
     0)  When the wings are close to being done, strain the stock so you can start making the gravy

  Scrape the pan drippings into the gravy
     0)  You don't have to do this, but it will add even more flavor to your gravy

     2) Add a cup of water to the pan and use a metal spatula to scrape up the drippings
     3) Pour them off into the gray pot
     4) To serve, pour the gravy over the wings

Ingredients:
   0) 6 tbsp unsalted butter plus more for pan
   1) 1  small onion finely chopped

	Roasted Spatchcock Chicken (Butterflied Chicken)
	By: Sam | Ahead of Thyme

From: https://www.aheadofthyme.com/roasted-spatchcock-chicken-butterflied-chicken/

Quick and easy roasted spatchcock chicken (butterflied chicken) seasoned with garlic and thyme is juicy, tender, delicious and flavourful with minimal prep.

Estimated Prep Time:  55 minutes
Servings: 1

Ingredients:
  0) 1  whole chicken  (3 to 4 lbs.)
  1) 2 tbsps olive oil divided
  2) 1 tbsp salt
  3) 1/2 tbsp ground black pepper
  4) 3  cloves garlic peeled  (+ 1 tablespoon minced)
  5) 1  sprig rosemary
  6) 2-3  sprigs thyme  (+1 tablespoon chopped)

Directions: 
  Spatchcock the Chicken:
     0) Pat dry the whole chicken completely dry with a paper towel before adding seasoning. This helps create extra crispy skin when roasting.
     1) Place chicken breast-side down on a clean and dry chopping board (wearing disposable gloves helps with easy handling).
     2) Cut along the backbone in the middle with kitchen scissors and remove the backbone, which is about 1-inch wide.
     3) Make a small cut with a knife along the white cartilage that connects the breastbone and remove the breastbone by pulling it out through the cut.
     4) Turn the chicken over with the breast-side up and flatten it out . Tuck the wings under the chicken breasts.
     5) Pat dry the spatchcock chicken again to remove any excess liquid.
  Season the Spatchcock Chicken:
     0) In a small bowl, stir together one tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper, until combined.
     1) Generously smear the seasoning mixture over the whole chicken inside and out and let it rest on a clean plate for at least 15 minutes.  Make sure the seasoning covers the entire whole chicken including the inside cavity.
  Roast the Chicken:
     0) Preheat the oven to 450F.
     1) Heat a cast-iron skillet on the stove for 5 minutes over medium high heat (or preheat the iron skillet in the oven for 5 minutes). Once the skillet is sizzling hot, sear the chicken by placing chicken breast side down in the hot skillet for 3-5 minutes, until skin gets a little crispy.
     2) Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake the chicken for 30 minutes until the skin on the breasts turns brown. You can add an oven-safe weight over the chicken such as a Dutch oven lid to promote browning.
     3) Remove the skillet from the oven and turn the chicken over with the breast side up. Tuck whole garlic cloves and sprigs of rosemary and thyme underneath the chicken to add flavour.
     4) Combine the remaining oil, chopped thyme and minced garlic in a small bowl and brush the seasoning mixture over the chicken breasts.
     5) Transfer the skillet back into the oven and continue to bake the chicken for another 10 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 165F.
     6) Remove the chicken from oven and place it on a large plate. Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes. Then, carve and serve.

     1) Toss with olive oil
     2) Sprinkle with salt

	By:

From: https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/hash-brown-casserole

Estimated Prep Time: 1 hour 30 minutes
Servings: 10

Ingredients:
   0) 6 tbsp unsalted butter plus more for pan
   1) 1  small onion finely chopped
   2) 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
   3) 2 1/2 cups whole milk
   4) 1 cup sour cream
   5) 2 tsp Diamond Crystal
   6) 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
   7) 1/4 tsp garlic powder
   8) 130 oz package frozen shredded hash browns thawed
   9) 10 oz sharp cheddar coarsely grated  (about 2½ cups)

Directions: 
  
     0) Preheat oven to 350°. Butter a 13x9\ baking dish. Melt 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming, about 2 minutes. Cook 1 small onion, finely chopped or coarsely grated, stirring often, until softened and translucent but without taking on any color, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle ¼ cup all-purpose flour over and stir until evenly distributed and no lumps remain. Pour in 2½ cups whole milk in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly until combined.

	Roasted Spatchcock Chicken (Butterflied Chicken)

From: https://www.aheadofthyme.com/roasted-spatchcock-chicken-butterflied-chicken/

Quick and easy roasted spatchcock chicken (butterflied chicken) seasoned with garlic and thyme is juicy, tender, delicious and flavourful with minimal prep.

Estimated Prep Time:  55 minutes
Servings: 1

Ingredients:
  0) 1  whole chicken  (3 to 4 lbs.)
  1) 2 tbsps olive oil divided
  2) 1 tbsp salt
  3) 1/2 tbsp ground black pepper
  4) 3  cloves garlic peeled  (+ 1 tablespoon minced)
  5) 1  sprig rosemary
  6) 2-3  sprigs thyme  (+1 tablespoon chopped)

Directions: 
  Spatchcock the Chicken:
     0) Pat dry the whole chicken completely dry with a paper towel before adding seasoning. This helps create extra crispy skin when roasting.
     1) Place chicken breast-side down on a clean and dry chopping board (wearing disposable gloves helps with easy handling).
     2) Cut along the backbone in the middle with kitchen scissors and remove the backbone, which is about 1-inch wide.
     3) Make a small cut with a knife along the white cartilage that connects the breastbone and remove the breastbone by pulling it out through the cut.
     4) Turn the chicken over with the breast-side up and flatten it out . Tuck the wings under the chicken breasts.
     5) Pat dry the spatchcock chicken again to remove any excess liquid.
  Season the Spatchcock Chicken:
     0) In a small bowl, stir together one tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper, until combined.
     1) Generously smear the seasoning mixture over the whole chicken inside and out and let it rest on a clean plate for at least 15 minutes.  Make sure the seasoning covers the entire whole chicken including the inside cavity.
  Roast the Chicken:
     0) Preheat the oven to 450F.
     1) Heat a cast-iron skillet on the stove for 5 minutes over medium high heat (or preheat the iron skillet in the oven for 5 minutes). Once the skillet is sizzling hot, sear the chicken by placing chicken breast side down in the hot skillet for 3-5 minutes, until skin gets a little crispy.
     2) Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake the chicken for 30 minutes until the skin on the breasts turns brown. You can add an oven-safe weight over the chicken such as a Dutch oven lid to promote browning.
     3) Remove the skillet from the oven and turn the chicken over with the breast side up. Tuck whole garlic cloves and sprigs of rosemary and thyme underneath the chicken to add flavour.
     4) Combine the remaining oil, chopped thyme and minced garlic in a small bowl and brush the seasoning mixture over the chicken breasts.
     5) Transfer the skillet back into the oven and continue to bake the chicken for another 10 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 165F.
     6) Remove the chicken from oven and place it on a large plate. Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes. Then, carve and serve.
